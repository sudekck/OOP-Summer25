#Normally, when you create a variable inside a function, that variable is local, and can be used inside that function. 
#To create a global variable inside a function, you can use the global keyword. 
#If you use the global keyword, the variable belongs to the global scope:
def myfunc():
    global x
    x = "fantastic"
myfunc()
print("Python is " + x)

#Also use the global keyword if you want to change a global variable inside a function. 
#To change the value of a global variable inside a function, refer to the variable by using the global keyword:

x = "awesome"
def myfunc():
    global x 
    x = "fantastic"
myfunc()
print("Python is " + x)
